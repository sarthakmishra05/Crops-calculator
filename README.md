### Key Functionality

* **Input:** The program prompts the user to input the **weight** of the crop (e.g., in kilograms or quintals).
* **Processing:** It utilizes a pre-defined or dynamically calculated **unit price** for the specific crop. The selling price is calculated using the formula:
    > Selling Price = Weight of Crop $\times$ Unit Price
* **Output:** The program outputs the final, calculated **selling price** at which the entered weight of the crop should be sold.

The program provides a straightforward and efficient way for farmers or vendors to estimate revenue.
